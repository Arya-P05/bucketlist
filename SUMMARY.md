# Bucket List App Project Summary

## Overview

We've built a full-stack bucket list application that allows users to:

- Create an account and log in
- Create and manage multiple bucket lists
- Add items to their bucket lists with descriptions, images, and links
- Delete bucket lists and items

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- RESTful API with proper authentication using JWT
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Ownership validation to ensure users can only access their own data

#### Key Endpoints:

- `/users` - User registration and management
- `/login` - Authentication and token generation
- `/bucket-lists` - Create, read, update, and delete bucket lists
- `/items` - Manage bucket list items

### Frontend (Next.js)

- Modern React application using Next.js and TypeScript
- Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Client-side form validation
- JWT authentication with secure token storage
- Protected routes redirecting to login if not authenticated

#### Key Pages:

- Home page with app introduction
- Login and Signup pages
- Dashboard showing user's bucket lists
- Bucket list detail view with items
- Add/edit forms for both bucket lists and items

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. Server authenticates and returns a JWT token
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. Token is sent with subsequent API requests
5. Backend validates token and ensures user only accesses their own data

## Future Improvements

Feel free to help implement these features if you'd like! I'd love to have multiple contributors to this project.

- Social sharing of bucket lists
- User profile management
- Collaborative bucket lists
- Direct image uploads
- Email notifications
- Mobile app version

## Development Approach

We followed a methodical approach to building this application:

1. Set up the backend API with proper authentication
2. Created the database schema and connection
3. Implemented the frontend with Next.js and Tailwind
4. Built reusable components and utilities
5. Connected frontend to backend API
6. Added form validation and error handling
7. Implemented protected routes and authentication flow

## Learning Outcomes

- Building a full-stack application with modern technologies
- Implementing secure authentication with JWT
- Designing and building RESTful APIs
- Managing state and side effects in React applications
- Creating responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Proper error handling and validation
