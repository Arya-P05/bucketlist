# Bucket List App Project Summary

## Overview

A full-stack bucket list application that allows users to:

- Create an account and log in
- Create and manage multiple bucket lists
- Add items to their bucket lists with descriptions, images, and links
- Delete bucket lists and items

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- RESTful API with proper authentication using JWT
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Ownership validation to ensure users can only access their own data

#### Key Endpoints:

- `/users` - User registration and management
- `/login` - Authentication and token generation
- `/bucket-lists` - Create, read, update, and delete bucket lists
- `/items` - Manage bucket list items

### Frontend (Next.js)

- Modern React application using Next.js and TypeScript
- Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Client-side form validation
- JWT authentication with secure token storage
- Protected routes redirecting to login if not authenticated

#### Key Pages:

- Home page with app introduction
- Login and Signup pages
- Dashboard showing user's bucket lists
- Bucket list detail view with items
- Add/edit forms for both bucket lists and items

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. Server authenticates and returns a JWT token
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. Token is sent with subsequent API requests
5. Backend validates token and ensures user only accesses their own data
